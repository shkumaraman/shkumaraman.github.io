    <h1>Razor VPN - Data Deletion & Third-Party SDK Policy</h1>

    <h2>Data Deletion Policy</h2>
    <p>
      At Razor VPN, we are committed to protecting user privacy. If you choose to delete your account or uninstall the app, all associated personal data will be permanently deleted from our systems within 7 days. This deletion is irreversible and ensures complete removal from our servers and databases.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Request Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      To request the deletion of your data, please contact us at <strong>mail@razorvpn.com</strong> with the subject line: <em>Data Deletion Request</em>. Kindly include your user ID or any identifying information used within the app, if available.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party SDK: AppLovin</h2>
    <p>
      Razor VPN previously used the AppLovin SDK for displaying advertisements and tracking ad performance. AppLovin may collect certain technical and usage data, which may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Model, OS version, advertising ID, language, screen size</li>
      <li><strong>App Usage Data:</strong> App open/close events, ad interactions, session duration</li>
      <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> Approximate location via IP address; precise location only if user grants permission</li>
      <li><strong>Ad Performance Metrics:</strong> Impressions, clicks, conversion tracking, attribution</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      No personally identifiable information (PII) such as name, email, or contacts is collected by AppLovin. All collected data is handled in accordance with AppLovin’s privacy policy and used strictly for ad-serving and analytics purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>Account Deletion Notice</h2>
    <p>
      When a user chooses to delete their account, all personal data is permanently erased from Razor VPN’s systems, including any data linked to third-party services. This ensures full compliance with data protection policies and gives users complete control over their information.
    </p>
